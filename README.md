# Parking Meter System - Tech Challenge


This repository contains the solution for the Parking Meter System Tech Challenge, developed as part of an academic project at FIAP. The goal of this project is to modernize and optimize an outdated parking meter system, focusing on enhancing performance, reliability, and scalability by leveraging modern APIs, efficient data persistence techniques, and optimized read/write operations.

## Project Overview
The original system experienced significant delays and errors in data reading and writing processes, impacting both users and enforcement officers. Our solution aims to resolve these issues by creating an optimized, scalable, and efficient system.

## Key Features:
API Design: The system uses modern Java APIs, including the Java Time API for handling parking time calculations efficiently.
Data Persistence: Implements a reliable persistence layer using either an in-memory or physical database (SQL or NoSQL), allowing for fast access and scalability.
Optimized Read/Write Operations: Techniques to minimize frequent database access, ensuring fast data read and write, thus improving overall system performance.
Scalability: The system is designed with scalability in mind, to handle a large number of parking transactions and to easily scale for future needs.

## Tech Stack
Backend: Java with Spring Boot<br> 
Database: PostgreSQL (SQL)<br> 
API Documentation: Swagger for API documentation and testing<br>
Build Tool: Maven
